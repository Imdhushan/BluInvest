      "content": "Sri Lanka’s 28 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) — with 8 more proposed — present an invaluable framework for targeted conservation management. These areas help preserve biodiversity and ensure the health of marine ecosystems. A place-based or “seascape” approach is essential for long-term success. This approach focuses on systematic improvements tailored to local challenges, addressing cumulative impacts and the needs of multiple stakeholders, including local communities and indigenous peoples. This ensures that conservation efforts are sustainable and equitable."

      "content": "The threats facing our oceans are increasingly urgent. Climate change, overfishing, coastal development, and pollution from plastics and ocean debris continue to threaten the health of our seas, jeopardising the safety and livelihoods of coastal communities. However, when oceans are healthy, the planet flourishes. Prosperous societies and peaceful communities depend on vibrant, thriving seas. To protect these valuable ecosystems, we need bold, innovative thinking — such as the WWF’s collaboration with the Walmart Foundation, which focuses on a place-based approach to sustainable seafood and leverages private sector action to scale conservation efforts."

      "content": "Volunteering in marine conservation projects is another powerful way to contribute to the cause. Around the world, people are joining efforts to protect coral reefs, swim with dolphins, and engage in innovative conservation projects that preserve marine life in some of the world’s most idyllic settings. This hands-on approach not only fosters environmental stewardship but also provides participants with the opportunity to directly contribute to the health of our oceans."

      "title": "Leveraging Private Sector Partnerships for a Sustainable Future",
      "content": "In Sri Lanka, these global conservation strategies align perfectly with the country’s goals. By partnering with the private sector, supporting CSR initiatives, and empowering local communities, we can protect marine assets and ensure sustainable management of MPAs. This collaborative effort will help drive pollution reduction, enhance biodiversity monitoring, and support blue carbon initiatives. Through innovation, collaboration, and a place-based approach, Sri Lanka can lead the way in marine biodiversity conservation, fostering long-term sustainability for its coastal communities and ecosystems."
