            The boat-building industry in Sri Lanka is a significant contributor to the countryâ€™s maritime economy, catering to domestic and international markets. This industry is governed by a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to ensure safety, environmental sustainability, and compliance with international standards. The regulations span multiple sectors, including maritime law, environmental protection, and international trade.
